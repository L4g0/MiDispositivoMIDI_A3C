# Important
You will need the following libraries to make the code work: MIDI USB and Adafruit NeoPixel
* https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

We also recommend using the Arduino Sketch to make the programming. Remember to select "Arduino Leonardo" as target board

# Codes
In each code you will find detailed information about each code. What it does, and how does it work. We also provide some exercises por people that want to mess arround with the controller.

# Changelog
* July 14th 2016: Initial release of code
* October 6th 2016: Hardware schematics are published.
